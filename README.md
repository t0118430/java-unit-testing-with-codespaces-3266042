The beauty of test-driven development is that it allows you to iterate your codebase one step at a time, testing and reworking individual cases as you go. Not only does this reduce the likelihood of bugs and errors, it also helps you write more effective and more reliable code.

In this course, instructor Bethan Palmer covers the essentials of unit testing in Java to showcase the benefits of test-driven development. Explore practical topics including common assertions, comparing arrays, and testing exceptions as well as some of the more advanced features of JUnit, the Java unit testing framework that lets you run parameterized tests. Along the way, take advantage of the opportunity to practice writing your own unit tests with hands-on, interactive coding exercises in GitHub Codespaces.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
